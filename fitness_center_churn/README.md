## Data

We have a file based on client questionnaires that contains the data of fitness center users for the month before the churn and the fact of the churn for a certain month:

- gender
- living or working in the area where the fitness center is located
- club partner company employee
- the fact of the initial registration as part of the "promo_friends"
- phone
- age
- time since the first access to the fitness center (in months)
- contract period
- term until the end of the contract
- the fact of attending group classes
- average frequency of visits per week since the start of the subscription
- average frequency of visits per week for the previous month
- total revenue from additional services of the fitness center
- fact of outflow in the current month (churn)

## Task

1. Learn to predict the probability of outflow (at the level of the next month) for each client;
2. Form typical portraits of clients: identify several of the most striking groups and characterize their main properties;
3. Analyze the main features that most strongly affect the outflow;
4. Formulate the main conclusions and develop recommendations for improving the quality of work with clients.
